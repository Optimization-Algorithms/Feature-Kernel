\section{Exprerimental Results}

In general \fk{} behaves very poorly. All the fallowing problems, taken from MIP lib, have been solved 
using the method described above. To be more concise we  present only the results from \fk{}, because 
the rest of the \ks{} is the same as in a standard implementation. 

In order to find some patterns and to identify the actual quality of the method all the following tests was
run with the same configuration:
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        Parameter & Value \\ \hline\hline
        Count & 50 \\ \hline
        Min Time & 10 \\ \hline
        Max Time & 40 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{\fk{} configuration}\label{tab:ks-config}
\end{table}

In this configuration are not present all the required parameters: the remaining are omitted because they are not 
involved into the way \fk{} works.

In the following examples we use a simple schema to show the name of the instance, its URL and a graph showing 
the convergence of the method. In the abscissa there is the \fk{} iteration, on the ordinate there is the \emph{usage ratio} (see \Cref{eq:usage-ratio}).
A \fk{} iteration can end in four different statuses (see \Cref{sec:submodel-result}), identified on each graph using four different colors, as described:
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        Status & Color \\ \hline\hline
        Infeasible & Red \\ \hline
        Linear Feasible & Blue \\ \hline
        Integer Feasible & Green \\ \hline
        Timeout & Black \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Color legend for feasibility convergence graphs}
\end{table}

\importExample{air03}{https://miplib.zib.de/instance_details_air03.html}

In this first example one can see that \fk{} starts finding and integer feasible solution
only when the $ur > 0.851$. Also is not \fk{} has not been ablo to find a linear feasible model 
until $ur < 0.768$. From the \Figure{} one can also notice that the magior part of the generated 
models are infeasible, so they are completly useless to identify informations about the importance 
of each variable. From \Table{} it is possible to see that $ur$ does not define a precise border between 
Infeasible and Linear Feasible region or between Linear and Integer Feasible region.


\importExample{beavma}{https://miplib.zib.de/instance_details_beavma.html}

In \Instance{} the situation is a bit different: \ks{} has not been able to find a Linear Feasbile model. 
Besides that also in this case reading carefully \Table{} allows to understand that $ur$ does not define any 
boarder. From \Figure{} one can see that \ks{} generated on 3 valid submodels for \Instance{}, and all with a $ur > 0.969$. 
This means that the value of the score computed by \ks{} is almost insignificant. An insignificant dataset will produce a 
meaningless random forrest that will bring to a meaningless kernel. 


\importExample{mas74}{https://miplib.zib.de/instance_details_mas74.html}

\Instance{} is a lucky case: it is the only where \ks{} has been able to find an Integer Feasible model with $ur < 0.85$, infact
